## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Having the Figma files to work from meant much more preplanning and identifying reusable elements. I was fairly happy with the foundation I came up with, although I believe I can improve upon the process moving forward.

### Continued development

I would like to come back and add some more sophisticated animations to bring the site more to life. I am also focused on making my grid layouts more fluid using clamp.

### Useful resources

- [Viewport Calculator](https://codepen.io/lakshmiR/pen/YGWXoo) - I used this handy codepen to help calculate my fluid font sizes.
